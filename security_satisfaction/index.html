<p>
The fast evolution of wearable technology has resulted in an increasing demand for adaptive and personalized context-aware applications. Experts recognized that quality attributes are the cornerstone to get healthy social implications of these applications. However, do end-users perceive these attributes as so important? To answer this question, we designed a survey to understand how end-users perceive the importance of security and satisfaction, respect to trust and usefulness, of context-aware software applications, and how users' personality types might influence their perceptions. To this end, we run an online survey that embeds two animated-demonstration videos in order to present i) the functionality of a context-aware mobile app, and ii) some vulnerabilities of the mobile app. The survey involved 48 subjects divided into two groups: subjects with software engineering background (Group A) and subjects without any engineering background (Group B). 
The results of this investigation show that the importance of security attributes, like confidentiality and integrity, is more clearly perceived by subjects with an engineering background. And accountability is more difficult to be perceived by all subjects. This difficulty can be even more pronounced for subjects without any engineering background. Our findings suggest that personality types (e.g., agreeableness, openness) influence only on perceived importance of security attributes such as confidentiality and integrity; whereas the importance of user satisfaction (trust and usefulness) might be affected by other contextual factors. The research has also confirmed a significant positive correlation between the perceived importance of security attributes and user satisfaction in context-aware applications. 
From a methodological perspective, our study highlights the importance of i) using personality tests to characterize end-users, in turn, get a better understanding on user perceptions, and ii) employing animated-demonstration videos as a medium to evaluate users reactions  face to different situations (positive and negatives).
